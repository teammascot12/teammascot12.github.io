        <h1>Moon Knight - A Crazy Dude Who Fights Crime</h1>
        <p>This page is specifically about the Marvel Superhero known as Moon Knight. His real name is Marc Spector, although he's crazy, so sometimes he thinks he's a few other people too. He gets his power from Khonshu, a sort of Egyptian god who is also sometimes his enemy ... sort of. It's complicated. Afterall, he is crazy.
