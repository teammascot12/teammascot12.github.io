        <h1>Daredevil - Lawyer By Day, <i>Superhero By Night</i></h1>
        <p>
            This page is specifically about the <b><u>Marvel Superhero known as Daredevil.</u></b> His given name is Matt Murdock. Matt Murdock is a man who was blinded by a radioactive substance that while blinding him, gave him supernatural heightened senses. Some of his super attributes include super hearing, heat sensitivity and sonar-like detection of objects around him. Once he discovered his abilities, he realized he could use these powers for good by fighting crime.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        In time, he learned that fighting crime is <mark>not easy</mark> and requires more than just super senses. So, he studied matial arts and learned fighting skills to go along with his new super abilities. <b>Oh ... and he's a lawyer. So there's that.</b>
